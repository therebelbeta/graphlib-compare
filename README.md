# graphlib-compare
A comparison of a few of the top js graphing libraries

I will be comparing the following:

* Is it free to use commercially?
* Will it meet the needs of API Analytics?
* Can it be loaded via browserify?
* Can it be dynamically updated as new data comes in?
* How flexible is the styling?
* Does it provide smooth user interaction?
