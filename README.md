# graphlib-compare
A comparison of a few of the top js graphing libraries

I will be comparing the following:

* LICENSE: Is it free to use commercially?
* NEEDS: Will it meet the needs of API Analytics?
* LOADING: Can it be loaded via browserify?
* DYNAMIC: Can it be dynamically updated as new data comes in?
* STYLING: How flexible is the styling?
* UX: Does it provide smooth user interaction?
* LEARNING CURVE: Is it easy to hop in and start using?
